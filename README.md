# hello-world

 **I** have a Bachelors in Science in Engineering Physics with emphasis on Bioengineering from the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. I plan on pursuit a Masterâ€™s Degree in Bioengineering, followed by a PhD. My several fields of interests includes self-sustainable renewable energy, bio-tissues and nanoscience. Currently I am involved in learnining git and web development and have worked on research projects such as Lunar Regolith ISRU in the past. I enjoy movies, fishing trips and spending my spare time playing guitar and reading.
